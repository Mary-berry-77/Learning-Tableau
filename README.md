# Airbnb Data Analysis for Aspiring Hosts

This project is based on the Tableau tutorial provided by [AlexTheAnalyst](https://www.youtube.com/@AlexTheAnalyst), specifically from this video: **[Airbnb Analysis Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOR0-nygfDE&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8GwbqoVmo_5zuhOa0Tcl3xC&index=6)**.

I’ve used the dataset provided by the tutorial and summarised the steps and insights gained during the analysis. This project is part of my learning journey with Tableau, and it’s tailored for aspiring Airbnb hosts to make data-driven decisions.

## Project Overview

This analysis is aimed at answering key questions for someone who is about to start an Airbnb business. The goal is to help potential hosts determine:

- **Where to buy a house and start renting it on Airbnb?**
- **What are the factors to consider when making this decision?**
- **What is the optimal price to charge and the best time to put the listing on the market?**

## Data Analysis Breakdown

The analysis includes several key visualizations and insights:

### 1. **Price by Zipcode (Sheet 1)**  
- **Objective:** Identify the most expensive areas for Airbnb rentals in 2016.
- **Key Insight:** Zipcode '98134' has the highest average price at $205.

### 2. **Price by Zipcode on Map (Sheet 2)**  
- **Objective:** Visualize the price distribution across different zip codes on a map.
- **Key Insight:** This helps understand regional price trends.

### 3. **Revenue for the Year (Sheet 3)**  
- **Objective:** Analyze revenue trends over the course of a year.
- **Key Insight:** The summer through late autumn (until early January) is the peak rental season, ideal for maximizing revenue.

### 4. **Revenue by Number of Bedrooms (Sheet 4)**  
- **Objective:** Determine how the number of bedrooms affects revenue.
- **Key Insight:** One-bedroom properties brought in the most revenue, totaling over $63 million.

### 5. **Average Price Per Bedroom (Sheet 5)**  
- **Objective:** Analyze the average price based on the number of bedrooms.
- **Key Insight:** The more bedrooms, the higher the price you can charge.

### 6. **Distinct Count of Bedroom Listings (Sheet 6)**  
- **Objective:** Understand how the number of listings varies by bedroom count.
- **Key Insight:** Smaller bedroom listings have the highest competition, but they do not necessarily bring in the most revenue.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights for aspiring Airbnb hosts who are looking to make data-driven decisions. By considering factors like location, the number of bedrooms, pricing strategy, and timing, hosts can optimize their Airbnb listings to maximize revenue.
